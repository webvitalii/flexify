	<h3>Q: Why do I need to use if if there are Bootstrap/Foundation/?</h3>
	
	<p>A: Good question. I was using Bootstrap for a long time and was pretty happy about it.
	But there are some thisng I missed in Bootstrap: support for flexbox, CSS dropdown menu which works on hover and not on click, etc.
	Every classname in Flexify is prefixed with [fx-] prefix for avoiding conflicts with other frameworks/libraries.
	You may use Flexify with another framework on the same project.
