			<h3>Q: Why do I need to use it if there are Bootstrap/Foundation/Etc?</h3>
			
			<p>A: I was using Bootstrap for a long time and was pretty happy about it.
			But there are some things I missed in Bootstrap: simplicity, CSS dropdown menu which works on hover and not on click, etc.
			Every classname in Flexify is prefixed with [fx-] prefix for avoiding conflicts with other frameworks/libraries.
			You may use Flexify with another framework on the same project.

			<h3>Q: Why Flexbox?</h3>
			
			<p>A: Flexbox provides simpler and more flexible layout options in CSS. More specifically, it provides:</p>
			
			<ul>
			<li>Easy vertical alignment of content within a parent element.</li>
			<li>Easy reordering of content across devices and screen resolutions with the help of media queries.</li>
			<li>Easy CSS-only equal height columns for your grid-based layouts.</li>
			<li>No need to clear floats.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Q: Why CSS and not SCSS/SASS/other preprocessor/ctc?</h3>
			
			<p>
			To run SCSS you need to install:
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Ruby</li>
				<li>SASS gem</li>
				<li>NPM</li>
				<li>Node.js</li>
				<li>etc...</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>To avoid installing all of that you can simply use CSS.</p>
