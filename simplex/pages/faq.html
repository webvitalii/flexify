			<h3>Q: Why do I need to use if if there are Bootstrap/Foundation/Etc?</h3>
			
			<p>A: I was using Bootstrap for a long time and was pretty happy about it.
			But there are some thisng I missed in Bootstrap: support for flexbox, CSS dropdown menu which works on hover and not on click, etc.
			Every classname in Flexify is prefixed with [fx-] prefix for avoiding conflicts with other frameworks/libraries.
			You may use Flexify with another framework on the same project.
